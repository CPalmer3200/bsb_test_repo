# Results repository for BSB coding test

## 1. Repository architecture

This repository contains Nextflow and Python scripts designed to process DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) reads. These scripts are designed to be run on a Linux-based/WSL system through bash scripts. 

### 1.1 Nextflow pipeline

The Nextflow pipeline is comprised of three scripts designed to be run in the order: 1. index_pipeline.nf, 2. mapping_pipeline.nf, 3. intersect_pipeline.nf. Below you will find a brief explanation of the scripts and their dependencies:


- index_pipeline.nf: This script retrieves the chromosome.fasta file stored in the data directory and indexes it using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA). Please            install and activate BWA in the current environment before running this script with:

```
nextflow run index_pipeline.nf
```
<br>

- mapping_pipeline.nf: This script is designed to map the sample.fastq.gz files to the indexed chromosome with bwa mem and convert these into .bam files with           samtools. The resulting .bam files will then be converted to .bed files using bedtools and the reads will be trimmed to include just the break sites by               accessing the trim_reads.py script in this repo. Please install and activate BWA, samtools, Python3 and bedtools before running this script with:

```
nextflow run mapping_pipeline.nf
```


> [!WARNING]
> This version of mapping_pipeline.nf does not use relative file paths due to incompabilities with external programs. Please modify the 'mapping_to_bam' parameters and trim_reads script (3 lines total) BEFORE running the script.
<br>

- intersect_pipeline.nf: This script uses bedtools to find the intersections between the trimmed .bed files and the AsiSI cut sites in the data folder. Please install and activate bedtools before running this script with:

```
nextflow run intersect_pipeline.nf
```


> [!WARNING]
> This version of intersect_pipeline.nf does not use relative file paths due to incompabilities with external programs. Please modify the 'find_intersections' parameters (2 lines total) BEFORE running the script.
<br>

### 1.2 Python analysis

This repository also contains a Python file to analyse the results generated by the Nextflow pipeline. This file requires the packages 'pandas' and 'matplotlib' to be installed in the activate environment before the script is run with:

```
python3 path/to/script path/to/trimmed/reads path/to/intersected/reads path/to/AsiSI/cut/sites
```

> [!NOTE]  
> The Python analysis script requires 4 arguments in the specified order and will raise a SystemExit exception if >4 or <4 arguments are given
<br>
